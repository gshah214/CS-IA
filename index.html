        <h4>A bit about me:</h4>
        <h4>After living in New Jersey for 30+ years, my family and I decided to make the move to Lutz, FL. I am happily married to my college sweetheart and we have two wonderful young children. The initial reason I got into real estate in New Jersey was to help my family manage the properties we owned. My first year in real estate helped me realize that helping buyers and sellers with the home sale process was and still is my true passion. With 15+ years of home buying and selling experience, I look forward to sharing that award winning expertise with my new clients in the Greater Tampa Bay area. Please feel free to ask me anything. I look forward to partnering with you and tackling your next real estate endeavor.</h4>
